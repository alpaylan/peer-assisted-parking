# Peer Assisted Parking(PAP)

PAP is a project designed for the Ericson Innovation Awards 2020. 

PAP aims to lower the congestion levels and CO2 emissions originating from on-street parking problem.

In PAP, we create a mesh network of vehicles communicating each other through V2V and C-ITS communications to notify the network of free parking spots. 

We believe that this optimisation has the potential to affect metropolitan area traffic congestions in great manner. 

A rough roadmap of the project is given in eia20.md file.
