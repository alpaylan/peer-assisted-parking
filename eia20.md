# The Plan

This document reports the plan for the development of the Peer Assisted Parking system.

## Simulation Phase 1

In phase 1, I will write 2 simulations of cities with cars.

First simulation is a city simulation for normal behaviour, without the help of PAP. Congestion levels and driver behaviour will be inspected.

Second simulation is a city simulation of PAP assisted driver behaviour. Congestion levels and driver behaviours will be compared with the control group.

## Simulation Phase 2

A ROS simulation with visual aids will be provided. Parking behaviour is going to be captured in a more detailed manner.

## Prototype

A miniature city will be constructed. Networking sides of the project will start appearing.

## Product
